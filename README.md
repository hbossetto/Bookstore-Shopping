Program written by Hunter Bossetto

This program was an assignment created for class.

In this program, the user will be able to enter the name and price of a book to their shopping cart. The user can enter as many books as they would like. Once the user is finished, they will simply click the button that will calculate then display the subtotal and the total with tax.
